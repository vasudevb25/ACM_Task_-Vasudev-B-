LOGIC GATES

A logic gate is a device that acts as a building block for digital circuits. Most electronic devices we use today will have some form of logic gates in them. Most logic gates have two inputs and one output. Logic gates are based on Boolean algebra. Every terminal is in one of the two binary conditions, false or true. False represents 0, and true represents 1. 

There are seven basic logic gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XNOR.

AND GATE

The AND gate is so named because, if 0 is called "false" and 1 is called "true," the gate acts in the same way as the logical "and" operator.

 Input 1        Input 2	       Output
 	 	 
   0              0              0
   1              0              0
   0              1              0
   1              1              1

OR GATE

The output is "true" if either or both of the inputs are "true." If both inputs are "false," then the output is "false."

 Input 1	Input 2	       Output
 	 	 
   0              0              0
   0              1              1
   1              0              1
   1              1              1

NOT GATE

NOT gate has only 1 input. It reverses the logic state. If the input is 1, then the output is 0. If the input is 0, then the output is 1. 

 Input	  Output

   1        0
   0        1

NAND GATE

The NAND gate operates as an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. The output is "false" if both inputs are "true." Otherwise, the output is "true."

 Input 1	 Input 2	Output

   0               0              1
   0               1              1
   1               0              1
   1               1              0

NOR GATE

The NOR gate is a combination OR gate followed by an inverter. Its output is "true" if both inputs are "false." Otherwise, the output is "false."

 Input 1	 Input 2	Output

   0               0              1
   0               1              0
   1               0              0
   1               1              0

XOR GATE

The XOR gate acts in the same way as the logical "either/or." The output is "true" if either, but not both, of the inputs are "true." The output is "false" if both inputs are "false" or if both inputs are "true."

 Input 1	 Input 2	Output
 	 	 
   0               0              0
   0               1              1
   1               0              1
   1               1              0

XNOR GATE

The XNOR gate is a combination XOR gate followed by an inverter. Its output is "true" if the inputs are the same, and "false" if the inputs are different.

 Input 1	 Input 2	Output

   0               0              1
   0               1              0
   1               0              0
   1               1              1
